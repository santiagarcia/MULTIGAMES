# Benchmarks

Record your machine, browser, grid size, dt, FPS, and observations here. Provide 5-second averages with light on and off.

Template:

- Machine: <model, CPU, iGPU/dGPU>
- Browser: <name, version>
- N: 128, L: 24, dt: 0.001
- Mode: Light off (no CAP)
  - FPS: ~
  - Norm drift over 1e4 steps: ~
- Mode: Light on (E0=0.02, Eph=20 eV)
  - FPS: ~
  - Emitted % after 5 s: ~
- Notes: Gauge match at low intensity? Any GC spikes?
